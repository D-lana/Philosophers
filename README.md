thread and mutex / fork and semafores
```

<h3>This project is about the basics of <i>threading</i> a process.

It is about how to create <i>threads</i> and  how to discover <i>mutexes</i>.</h3>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<b>1)</b> One or more philosophers sit at a round table. 

There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

<b>2)</b> The philosophers alternatively <b>eat, think, or sleep</b>.

While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;

while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;

and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

<b>3)</b> There are also forks on the table. 

There are as many forks as philosophers.

<b>4)</b> Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient,

a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

<b>5)</b> When a philosopher has finished eating,

they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. 

Once awake, they start thinking again.

The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

<b>6)</b> Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

<b>7)</b> Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

<b>8)</b> Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

<b>9)</b> No need to say that <b>philosophers should avoid dying!</b>
